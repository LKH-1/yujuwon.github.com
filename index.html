            <p>My favorite movie in my life is King and Clown. The King and Clown is very popular movie in Korea.
            The number of the movie's crowd is over ten million.</p>
            <p>At the Joseon Dynasty period, Jangsang a clown is against the nobility.
            And he is leaving for the Hanyang Joseon's capital with his best friend Gonggil.
            They participate in a play at Hanyang street. But the play satirized the King of Joseon.</p>
            	<p>After all, they were arrested. To survive, they participate in a play afront of the King.
            	The King is interested in theirs play. And they stay in the palace. 
            	In the palace, they satirized the nobility. And the king killed th nobility. </p>
            	<p>Jangsang and Gonggil want that they leave the palace. But the king did not a release.
            	Jangsang to reave the palace set against the king. And Jangsang loose his eyes by the King for Gonggil.
            	Jangsang and Gonggil was ready to run the risk of losing everything.</p>
